# Hello world
- This world is defined by natural language.
- We'll use some DSL(Domain Specific Language) to make things easy.
- For example, when we define some emotion, we'll use ETML(Emotion-in-Text Markup Language).
- We're looking carefully all you are in front of display, and we'll tweak this world dynamically.
